            <h2>Canadian fans boo US anthem</h2>
            <p>A few hours after President Donald Trump announced that he would impose steep tariffs on Canada, hockey
                fans in the capital Ottawa booed the Star-Spangled Banner during a National Hockey League game against a
                visiting US team.
                On Sunday, during a National Basketball Association game between the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles
                Clippers, it happened again, continuing throughout the song and almost drowning out the 15-year-old
                singer's arena performance.
                The vocal displeasure from usually respectful fans is a clear sign of Canadians' deep dismay at Trump's
                move to hit its nearest ally with punitive taxes, which threaten to spark an unprecedented trade war on
                the North American continent.
                The 25% tariffs imposed by Trump on all Canadian imports into the US - with a lower 10% levy on energy -
                are set to take effect on Tuesday.</p>

            <h2>German immigrarion bill rejected</h2>
            <p>The German parliament has rejected immigration measures put forward by the conservative opposition and
                backed by the far-right.
                Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to be Germany's next chancellor,
                had tried to rely on support from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party for the second time in a week
                - but the bill was defeated by 350 votes to 338.
                The strategy was widely condemned, including by Merz's predecessor as CDU leader and former chancellor
                Angela Merkel, who accused him of turning his back on a previous pledge not to work with AfD in the
                Bundestag.</p>
